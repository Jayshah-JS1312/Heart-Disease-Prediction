# Heart-Disease-Prediction
Machine Learning Project for heart disease prediction.

# Algorithms
In this project of Machine Learning 3 algorithms i.e. SVM ,Decision Tree and Random Forest are used in order to predict whether is heart disease or not.

# Dataset
The dataset is downloaded from this link: https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci

# Libraries
Some basic libraries of Python are used.Pandas is used for reading data from csv file and for further manipulation of data. Matplotlib is used for visualization of data. Scikit learn library is used for machine learning algorithms.
